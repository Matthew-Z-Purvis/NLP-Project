	Good evening Chemistry Stars,

	Tonight's Chemistry MGSP will be led by me in MI103 from 2000-2100. Please come with questions and be ready to learn!

	The Midshipmen Group Study Program (MGSP) provides regularly scheduled, out-of-class, peer-led group study sessions. We can work together to compare notes on content, discuss important concepts, and develop better study strategies. Students are responsible for knowing and following their instructor’s collaboration policy before working on any graded assignments at MGSP.

	Very Respectfully,

Dear 3/C Data Science majors,

You are invited to attend the Computer Science Department’s Capstone Proposal Poster Session if you are available and are interested in seeing the capstone projects being developed this year by the 1/C majors. 


Although these are computer science and information technology proposals, you may find some of them interesting from a data science perspective.  You will undertake a capstone project of your own during your senior year as part of SD475: Data Science Capstone.

We will be using a poster session format, so you are free to come and go as your schedule permits (and do not have to stay for the entire session). 

*	Date: Thursday, 10 November 2022
*	Location: HP103
*	Times: Held in three poster sessions, with different projects in each session: 

	*	Session I (0815-0915), 
	*	Session II (1015-1115), and 
	*	Session III (1330-1415)

Details on the 1/C capstone project proposals: Here are some details on the projects in each session <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XLQo1Q87mCoPwyxpBsaLl9RUNArbT2PoMNjNNMGzUkc/edit?usp=sharing> .

Happy Sunday 29,

If you're as bad at golf as me but want an extended EOL next Sunday, keep reading.  As you should know we are having our golf scramble on Sunday 23Oct at Bay Hills Golf Course.  Everyone who isn't golfing is welcome to come around 1730 to join us for dinner (this is for food and drinks) at the course for the low price of $10 (you can venmo Casey Carson @ccarson26).  Email me back if you would like to come!! You are responsible for providing transportation to and from the course however underclassmen do NOT let that stop you from coming.  We are working out rides as best as we can.  

Again if you come you will have extended EOL to 2000 and if you do not come your EOL is at normal time, 1800.

If MIDN are able to safely get to the mat room in the am tomorrow, Ram will be there to run a practice.  Nobody needs to drive onto the yard though to come coach.  Capt Escamilla, if you still desire to walk over and can get to the mat room, by all means, continue with your plan.  No idea just how bad this flooding is going to get, hopefully it's nothing crazy.

	ALCON,

	Due to weather impacts, there is no practice tonight or tomorrow morning.  No need for any coaches to come in tonight or tomorrow morning.  See you on the mats tomorrow afternoon hopefully.....(if everything floods, things could be cancelled again tomorrow afternoon).  Thank you for being flexible.

		Good Evening Family,
		Morning class is going to start going steady starting Wednesday. Also for the group who comes please send me anything you would like to work on and we’ll make it happen. Different Coaches, smaller groups, and unique techniques combined with being half asleep can reignite your passion for jiu jitsu after the holiday. Have an awesome first day of school.

Brigade, 

BLUF: Sign up to volunteer at the Fueling Station next week using this link.  <https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0f44a4ad28a5fbc70-fueling> 


The Fueling Station's hours next week will be: Mon-Thurs 1300-1630. 

This week, the demand for the fueling station was exceptional; however, due to our lower volunteer numbers and the increase in demand, we are going to change the station's policy to now allow 2 items per person rather than 3. We hope this will allow more of you to take advantage of our offerings.

Please continue signing up at the volunteer link above to ensure we are able to stock the station to the maximum capacity and serve the greatest number of midshipmen. The 10 hours per earned weekend incentive still stands.

Please reach out if you have any questions.

Best Batt,


The DOD Cyber Awareness Challenge 2022 is due before 01SEP (Thursday) or you will lose all access to USNA networks. 

You can complete this challenge at https://jkodirect.jten.mil/ (requires CAC) or https://public.cyber.mil/training/cyber-awareness-challenge/ (does not require CAC). 

IMPORTANT UPDATE: You must upload this to the 'U:\Cyber Awareness Challenge' drive on your personal computer. There is a slideshow attached to this email showing how to upload this certificate on your computer. If your certificate is already in the designated battalion folder, you will need to move it to the U:\Cyber Awareness Challenge Drive.


 Uploading Cyber Awareness Challenge 2022 <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18IRXJUXsbcCJuthNMcNzQtqR72aOxHo4c1MjlF1Z1Qo/edit?usp=drive_web> 


You need to have a 2022 certificate (not 2020 or 2021). You can use the certificate that you earned by completing the DOD Cyber Awareness Challenge 2022 from October in 2021 as long as the certificate says '2022' on it. For 4/C - 1/C this certificate must have been completed within the current fiscal year which started 01 OCT 2021. The upper class should have a certificate within this time range if you did your JKOs/NKOs last year.

I recommend you check the JKO/NKO site or last year's NKO/JKO tracking folders to see if you have a certificate.

Feel free to reach out to myself or your respective company MISLO with questions and concerns. We do not want you to lose access to the mission network.

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.. This is DUE AT TAPS ON THURSDAY. IT IS A TAPS REQUIREMENT. Once you're done fill out this tracker !!!

The military’s own confidential assessments of over 1,300 reports of civilian casualties since 2014, obtained by The Times, lays bare how the air war has been marked by deeply flawed intelligence, rushed and often imprecise targeting and the deaths of thousands of civilians, many of them children.

4. Congress ended its session with divisions as bitter as ever.

President Biden and Democrats can point to some major successes in 2021, including a $1.9 trillion pandemic aid plan with a $300-per-child income support that slashed poverty rates; a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law that had eluded the two previous presidents; the confirmation of 40 judges in Biden’s first year <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/Nr0RBS8rb8M3NYUp1_cLYw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRjoZ8-P0TjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xOC91cy9wb2xpdGljcy9iaWRlbi1qdWRnZXMtcmVhZ2FuLXJlY29yZC5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMTEyMTkmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9NDgyMzYmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD0xNzA4ODI3MjMmc2VnbWVudF9pZD03NzQzMSZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9ZTMyNzIwYzIwMThmZjY1OTYxYzg0MDNmZGY4MjEyNGNXA255dEIKYb4-Gr9hd3mObVIQbTI1MDA3MkB1c25hLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~> , the most of any president since Ronald Reagan; and a House inquiry into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

5. We’re waiting for election results out of Hong Kong, but the writing is already on the wall.

Almost all of the affected lawmakers are Democrats. Most of the mapmakers are white Republicans.

Because partisan gerrymandering has long been difficult to disentangle from racial gerrymandering, proving the motive can be troublesome. But the effect remains the same: less political power for communities of color.

Last spring, Black and Asian groups stood together in response to the violence aimed at their communities. But calls for unity have ebbed over disagreements on one main issue <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/NKdj9ePHGjQ6NdzOpUjPAg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRjoZ8-P0TraHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xOS91cy9ibGFjay1hc2lhbi1hY3RpdmlzdHMtcG9saWNpbmctZGlzYWdyZWVtZW50Lmh0bWw_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIxMTIxOSZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD00ODIzNiZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTE3MDg4MjcyMyZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTc3NDMxJnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1lMzI3MjBjMjAxOGZmNjU5NjFjODQwM2ZkZjgyMTI0Y1cDbnl0Qgphvj4av2F3eY5tUhBtMjUwMDcyQHVzbmEuZWR1WAQAAAAA> : policing.

Si Spiegel is one of the last living World War II bombers.Carly Zavala for The New York Times	
7. Si Spiegel can claim a dual legacy: as a war hero and as a father of the artificial tree <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/qza4-ZbzJ2NsLS2gBSHkiQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRjoZ8-P0TiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xNy9ueXJlZ2lvbi9ib21iZXItcGlsb3QtY2hyaXN0bWFzLXRyZWVzLmh0bWw_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIxMTIxOSZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD00ODIzNiZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTE3MDg4MjcyMyZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTc3NDMxJnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1lMzI3MjBjMjAxOGZmNjU5NjFjODQwM2ZkZjgyMTI0Y1cDbnl0Qgphvj4av2F3eY5tUhBtMjUwMDcyQHVzbmEuZWR1WAQAAAAA> .

Spiegel, 97, is one of the last bomber pilots of World War II still with us. He flew a B-17 on dozens of dangerous missions, saved his crew by belly-landing in a frozen potato field in Poland and then helped orchestrate a daring escape back out. But, like many other Jewish soldiers, he was denied promotion and, after the war, he was frozen out of aviation.

Instead, Spiegel went to vocational school and found a job as a machinist at a brush manufacturer. His bosses decided to repurpose the brush machines to make Christmas trees. Spiegel would go on to perfect their design and retired from his own artificial tree company, American Tree and Wreath, in 1993 as a multimillionaire. And there’s much more to his extraordinary life.

Matthew Grimes, 13, and his brother, David, 11, started participating in e-sports during the pandemic.Jake Dockins for The New York Times	
8. Gen Z is moving away from basketball courts and soccer fields and toward PlayStations and Xboxes. The rise of e-sports is shaking up an entire industry.

Participation in youth sports was declining even before Covid-19. Then, between at-home learning and the shutdown of youth sports, a high-tech generation found even more escape and engagement <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/6nNJ1sao2C7V7-6KvM3BWw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRjoZ8-P0TeaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xOS9zcG9ydHMvZXNwb3J0cy1mYW5zLWxlYWd1ZXMtZ2FtZXMuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjExMjE5Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTQ4MjM2Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9MTcwODgyNzIzJnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9Nzc0MzEmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWUzMjcyMGMyMDE4ZmY2NTk2MWM4NDAzZmRmODIxMjRjVwNueXRCCmG-Phq_YXd5jm1SEG0yNTAwNzJAdXNuYS5lZHVYBAAAAAA~>  on its smartphones and consoles. Even the Y.M.C.A. is getting on board: In April, it began a national e-sports pilot program in 120 of its U.S. branches.

In the second year of the American Sea Power Project, we're zeroing in on the application of sea power in the face of assertive Chinese and Russian behavior. This month's article explains that protection of maritime trade is increasingly a cyber task.

We hope you’ll read, discuss, and share the articles widely. We encourage all our readers to join the debate.

Lobbyists kept tabs on sports betting legislation in Kansas in April.Amir Hamja for The New York Times	

A boom

Four years ago, betting on live sports was illegal in most of the United States. Now, fans watching games or attending them at stadiums are barraged with advertisements encouraging them to bet on matchups, not just watch as spectators.

This transformation in sports betting started nearly a decade ago, at first with the explosion of wagering on fantasy sports. Then in 2018, the Supreme Court cleared the way for states to legalize wagers on live games. Today, 31 states <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/qaO98QPUqtkQ1SAw1YnM-w~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRlXej3P0TxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1lcmljYW5nYW1pbmcub3JnL3dwLWNvbnRlbnQvdXBsb2Fkcy8yMDIwLzA4L0FHQS1TcG9ydHMtQmV0dGluZy1NYXAtMjAyMGF4LnBkZj9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjIxMTIxJmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTc4MTU2Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9MTcwODgyNzIzJnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTEzODE0JnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1lMzI3MjBjMjAxOGZmNjU5NjFjODQwM2ZkZjgyMTI0Y1cDbnl0Qgpjc_dje2PwHq0eUhBtMjUwMDcyQHVzbmEuZWR1WAQAAAAA>  and Washington, D.C., permit sports gambling either online or in person, and five more states have passed laws that will allow such betting in the future. Professional sports in the U.S. now are part of a multibillion-dollar corporate gambling enterprise.

This shift represents the largest expansion of gambling in United States history. Several of my Times colleagues and I spent months investigating how the industry expanded, and today I want to highlight some of our findings.


Unmet promises

Once sports betting was more broadly legalized, casinos teamed up with sports betting platforms like FanDuel and DraftKings, along with the major professional sports teams, to go state by state to push lawmakers to embrace it. Part of their tool kit for persuasion? Millions of dollars in contributions from the sports betting companies and their allies to those lawmakers’ campaigns for office.

We found that gambling industry representatives had told legislators they could expect to see significant tax benefits from sports betting. In many states, that windfall has fallen short.

Take Michigan, home to the Detroit Tigers, Lions, Red Wings and Pistons professional teams, along with another two dozen college athletics N.C.A.A. programs — in short, a whole lot of sports to bet on. Online sports betting started in that state in January 2021, and the American Gaming Association predicted that state legislators could expect to see more than $40 million a year in tax revenues. What has Michigan collected in the last year? Just $21 million in state and local taxes, according to the Michigan Gaming Control Board.

The gambling industry also pressed states to keep tax rates low on sports betting, warning that if the states pushed rates too high, sports fans would turn to the black market to place bets on unregulated sites. Those warnings were misplaced. Some states, including New York and New Hampshire, ignored the industry’s advice and installed the highest tax rates on betting. They have seen bets placed at a higher rate per capita than many low-tax states. New York has seen so much betting — even with a high tax rate of 51 percent — that the state has collected an extraordinary $546 million in taxes in the first 10 months of this year. That amount is half of all the state tax revenues on sports betting nationwide.


Little oversight

Many of the states also allowed the gambling industry to give out hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of tax-free bets to gamblers, essentially marketing the industry. The promotions are intended to entice new customers to form a new habit: placing wagers on games. It is the modern-day equivalent of the free bus ride to Atlantic City casinos with a roll of quarters thrown in for the slots. Arizona sports betting operators alone gave out $205 million in free bets <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/9pvAJ7zgxfgBap5K5EAfyA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRlXej3P0T2aHR0cHM6Ly9pbnQubnl0LmNvbS9kYXRhL2RvY3VtZW50dG9vbHMvYXJpem9uYS0yMDIyLTIwMjEtY29tYmluZWQtZGF0YS9jZjQyMDc4OGFiNWE1NjA3L2Z1bGwucGRmP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMjExMjEmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9NzgxNTYmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD0xNzA4ODI3MjMmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMTM4MTQmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWUzMjcyMGMyMDE4ZmY2NTk2MWM4NDAzZmRmODIxMjRjVwNueXRCCmNz92N7Y_AerR5SEG0yNTAwNzJAdXNuYS5lZHVYBAAAAAA~> . But for states, the result was large shortfalls in expected tax revenues in places like Michigan and Virginia. Some, Virginia included, moved to curtail the tax-free bets.

The promotions were one example of how regulators were outmatched in trying to oversee the industry as it grew so rapidly. Rule enforcement was scattershot, punishments were light or rare, and regulators often looked to the gambling industry to police itself.

One casino company, Penn Entertainment, teamed up <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/-drFKMZUWct4EM8SH7LGVA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRlXej3P0TsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8yMC9idXNpbmVzcy9iYXJzdG9vbC1zcG9ydHMtYmV0dGluZy1kYXZpZC1wb3J0bm95Lmh0bWw_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIyMTEyMSZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD03ODE1NiZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTE3MDg4MjcyMyZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTExMzgxNCZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9ZTMyNzIwYzIwMThmZjY1OTYxYzg0MDNmZGY4MjEyNGNXA255dEIKY3P3Y3tj8B6tHlIQbTI1MDA3MkB1c25hLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~>  with David Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, who has a history of misogynistic and racist behavior, turning him into a public spokesman for sports betting.


University involvement

To market their expansion of sports betting, gambling sites reached unusual agreements with at least eight universities, including Michigan State, the University of Colorado at Boulder and Louisiana State University. The schools became partners with the companies in exchange for millions of dollars in payments. These deals generated questions about whether promoting gambling on campus — especially to people who are at an age when they are vulnerable to developing gambling disorders — fits the mission of higher education.


More to come

At least $161 billion in wagers have been placed since sports betting was broadly legalized in the United States. This explosion of gambling is just the start. Betting companies have made clear that the ultimate goal is to bring so-called iGaming to states across the nation, where customers can use their mobile phones to play blackjack, poker and other casino-style games.

A historical mystery, solved

Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address lasted two minutes, so brief that the photographers in attendance missed the moment. Because of that, experts have never been sure about where, exactly, he delivered the speech. Now a former Disney animator and self-described “Lincoln freak” says he has solved the mystery <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/WeaFSsdtVYRD4V3Vg6RE4A~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRlXej3P0TkaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xOC9hcnRzL2xpbmNvbG4tZ2V0dHlzYnVyZy1hZGRyZXNzLW9ha2xleS5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMjExMjEmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9NzgxNTYmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD0xNzA4ODI3MjMmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMTM4MTQmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWUzMjcyMGMyMDE4ZmY2NTk2MWM4NDAzZmRmODIxMjRjVwNueXRCCmNz92N7Y_AerR5SEG0yNTAwNzJAdXNuYS5lZHVYBAAAAAA~> .

The sleuth, Christopher Oakley, analyzed other photographs from the day to triangulate the photographers’ positions, then merged them with 3-D modeling software. After years of research, he presented his findings last week to the Lincoln Forum, a gathering of scholars and enthusiasts, and received a standing ovation.

Harold Holzer, the forum’s chairman, called Oakley’s work “ingenious.” For enthusiasts, he said, discovering the exact location “is as crucial as discovering where Moses got the Ten Commandments.”

*	What to know: Multiple large storm systems are forecast to slice across the country in the coming days, powered by an exceptionally active weather system <https://s2.washingtonpost.com/3c4db92/6597ecfe3c4e113033d0e95f/63a39ce6f7d0347081101b3a/39/66/6597ecfe3c4e113033d0e95f> .
*	What to watch: A snowstorm on the East Coast <https://s2.washingtonpost.com/3c4db94/6597ecfe3c4e113033d0e95f/63a39ce6f7d0347081101b3a/40/66/6597ecfe3c4e113033d0e95f> , big waves <https://s2.washingtonpost.com/3c4db96/6597ecfe3c4e113033d0e95f/63a39ce6f7d0347081101b3a/41/66/6597ecfe3c4e113033d0e95f>  and snow in California, then possible blizzards in the Midwest, tornadoes in the South and flooding in the East.

(The Washington Post)

*	Where? Washington has the highest U.S. minimum wage at $16.28 per hour. California and some parts of New York rose to $16. Check each state’s jump here <https://s2.washingtonpost.com/3c4db95/6597ecfe3c4e113033d0e95f/63a39ce6f7d0347081101b3a/44/66/6597ecfe3c4e113033d0e95f> .
*	What it means: The increases will bump wages for about 9.9 million workers, one analysis shows. Women make up a majority of those receiving a wage increase.

*	What that means: Willis Gibson drove the classic Nintendo game to a “true kill screen” — when the game freezes because it can’t keep up with score calculations.

Donald Trump in Warren, Mich., this weekend.Brittany Greeson for The New York Times	

‘A relentless desire’

Donald Trump is the leading candidate to be the Republican nominee for president — for the third straight election — and he’s also a subject of multiple criminal investigations. My colleague Maggie Haberman has been covering him the entire time and has written a book about him, “Confidence Man,” <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/SMSWx7RQfWjoslLsu4XSYA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRlHUNRP0ToaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVuZ3VpbnJhbmRvbWhvdXNlLmNvbS9ib29rcy82NjgyOTMvY29uZmlkZW5jZS1tYW4tYnktbWFnZ2llLWhhYmVybWFuLz9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjIxMDAzJmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTczNTgzJm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9MTcwODgyNzIzJnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTA4ODA3JnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1lMzI3MjBjMjAxOGZmNjU5NjFjODQwM2ZkZjgyMTI0Y1cDbnl0QgpjM1G-OmNZRjvdUhBtMjUwMDcyQHVzbmEuZWR1WAQAAAAA>  being published tomorrow.

For today’s newsletter, I spoke with Maggie about what she’s learned, about how much the media should cover Trump and about what’s likely next for him. And click here <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/4ozevJ9wi8vw7j5U3FdhWg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRlHUNRP0ToaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wMy9icmllZmluZy9kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtbWFnZ2llLWhhYmVybWFuLWJvb2suaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjIxMDAzJmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTczNTgzJm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9MTcwODgyNzIzJnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTA4ODA3JnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1lMzI3MjBjMjAxOGZmNjU5NjFjODQwM2ZkZjgyMTI0Y1cDbnl0QgpjM1G-OmNZRjvdUhBtMjUwMDcyQHVzbmEuZWR1WAQAAAAA>  to hear a couple of audio clips from her interviews with him.

David: You’ve spent more time covering and interviewing Trump than almost anybody, back to your days observing him when you were a New York Post reporter in the 1990s. You’ve also pointed out <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/rb1R9x7uyOhWAv8TmckFcA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRlHUNRP0TmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAxOC8xMC8xOC91cy9wb2xpdGljcy9kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtZm9yZWlnbi1sZWFkZXJzLmh0bWw_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIyMTAwMyZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD03MzU4MyZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTE3MDg4MjcyMyZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEwODgwNyZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9ZTMyNzIwYzIwMThmZjY1OTYxYzg0MDNmZGY4MjEyNGNXA255dEIKYzNRvjpjWUY73VIQbTI1MDA3MkB1c25hLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~>  that he lies a lot <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/4_uU5pBSEtfY-mk1kXJXrw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRlHUNRP4QVAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjAvMTEvMDYvdXMvZWxlY3Rpb25zL3RydW1wLWxpZXMtaW4tdGhlLXdoaXRlLWhvdXNlLWJyaWVmaW5nLXJvb20tYW5kLXRoZS1uZXR3b3Jrcy1wdWxsLXRoZS1wbHVnLmh0bWw_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIyMTAwMyZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD03MzU4MyZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTE3MDg4MjcyMyZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEwODgwNyZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9ZTMyNzIwYzIwMThmZjY1OTYxYzg0MDNmZGY4MjEyNGNXA255dEIKYzNRvjpjWUY73VIQbTI1MDA3MkB1c25hLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~> . Given that, I’m curious: How does interviewing him help you better capture reality when he is not confined by reality?

Maggie: He’s a former president and a potential future candidate, with huge influence over the party. Among other things, interviewing him helps illuminate how he keeps that influence: his obsession with us-versus-them politics, with salesmanship and with presenting a version of himself that is often very different from who he actually is.

Additionally, there are moments of unintended candor by him.

David: Yes, like his comments to you about the letters from Kim Jong-un that Trump apparently kept after leaving the White House. (Listen to that clip by clicking on the web version of this newsletter <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/4ozevJ9wi8vw7j5U3FdhWg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRlHUNRP0ToaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wMy9icmllZmluZy9kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtbWFnZ2llLWhhYmVybWFuLWJvb2suaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjIxMDAzJmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTczNTgzJm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9MTcwODgyNzIzJnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTA4ODA3JnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1lMzI3MjBjMjAxOGZmNjU5NjFjODQwM2ZkZjgyMTI0Y1cDbnl0QgpjM1G-OmNZRjvdUhBtMjUwMDcyQHVzbmEuZWR1WAQAAAAA> .) That’s gotten a lot of attention recently.

Maggie: It was a question I asked on a lark, during our third interview for my book, held at his club at Bedminster, N.J., on Sept. 16, 2021. I asked him if he had taken any “memento” documents from the White House, knowing how proud he had been of items like his letters from the authoritarian Kim Jong-un.

Trump’s immediate response was to deny having taken anything significant, saying, “Nothing of great urgency, no,” before — unsolicited — mentioning the Kim Jong-un letters, appearing to suggest he had them in his possession. A few months later, we learned he had a huge trove of White House material, including dozens of individual documents with classified markings.

David: As I listened to the clip, it felt like part of a pattern with him. He was certainly not being straightforward. But he was also being just vague and confusing enough that it was hard to pin down exactly what he was saying. As the journalist Joe Klein has written <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/C_EW6nQibX2j4Khj1PnUVA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRlHUNRP0T2aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8yOC9ib29rcy9yZXZpZXcvY29uZmlkZW5jZS1tYW4tZG9uYWxkLXRydW1wLW1hZ2dpZS1oYWJlcm1hbi5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMjEwMDMmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9NzM1ODMmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD0xNzA4ODI3MjMmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMDg4MDcmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWUzMjcyMGMyMDE4ZmY2NTk2MWM4NDAzZmRmODIxMjRjVwNueXRCCmMzUb46Y1lGO91SEG0yNTAwNzJAdXNuYS5lZHVYBAAAAAA~> , referring to this larger pattern, “He deployed words with a litigator’s precision — even if it sounded the opposite.”

Maggie: That’s exactly it, and one of the difficulties of interviewing him, or tracking what he says, is he is often both all over the place and yet somewhat careful not to cross certain lines. This was a hallmark of his business career, when he would tell employees not to take notes, although behind closed doors with employees he tended to be clearer in his directives.

At his rally at the Ellipse on Jan. 6, he told people to go “peacefully and patriotically” but also directed them to the Capitol with apocalyptic language about the election. Frequently, people around him understand the implications of words, even when he’s not being direct.

David: Our readers can also listen to a clip <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/4ozevJ9wi8vw7j5U3FdhWg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRlHUNRP0ToaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8wMy9icmllZmluZy9kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtbWFnZ2llLWhhYmVybWFuLWJvb2suaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjIxMDAzJmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTczNTgzJm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9MTcwODgyNzIzJnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTA4ODA3JnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1lMzI3MjBjMjAxOGZmNjU5NjFjODQwM2ZkZjgyMTI0Y1cDbnl0QgpjM1G-OmNZRjvdUhBtMjUwMDcyQHVzbmEuZWR1WAQAAAAA>  of him telling you that he wasn’t watching the Jan. 6 rally on television. Isn’t there widespread documentation to the contrary?

Maggie: His aides told The Times that day and in the following days that he was watching television, and a public hearing held this year by the House committee investigating Jan. 6 documented that he was watching television. It represents two things, I think — his desire to construct an alternate reality, and his particular sensitivity to anyone suggesting he watches a lot of television, which he associates with people diminishing his intelligence (even though he watches a very large amount of television).

David: How do you approach an interview with Trump?

Maggie: I try to get specific pieces of information, answers that only he would have, even with all the caveats about what can be believed coming out of his mouth. One example was when I asked if he would be facing the same legal troubles if Robert Morgenthau, the former Manhattan district attorney, still held the office. His answer was no, because Morgenthau was “a friend of mine.” That was revealing about Trump’s engagement with prosecutors, as he has escaped one investigation after another over years.

Maggie Haberman has observed Trump for decades.Amanda Andrade-Rhoades for The New York Times	
David: You’ve written that Trump has a “relentless desire to hold the media’s gaze.” <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/2bpKTKsD8GsKcbmKvqh8kg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRlHUNRP0T3aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYXRsYW50aWMuY29tL2lkZWFzL2FyY2hpdmUvMjAyMi8wOS9kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtbWFnZ2llLWhhYmVybWFuLW1hci1hLWxhZ28vNjcxNTEwLz9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjIxMDAzJmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTczNTgzJm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9MTcwODgyNzIzJnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTA4ODA3JnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1lMzI3MjBjMjAxOGZmNjU5NjFjODQwM2ZkZjgyMTI0Y1cDbnl0QgpjM1G-OmNZRjvdUhBtMjUwMDcyQHVzbmEuZWR1WAQAAAAA>  Do we cover him too much?

Maggie: I think the criticism about too much coverage of Donald Trump felt very real to his primary opponents in 2016, and often to the Clinton campaign. But I would argue that he was leading the polls in the primaries and that the coverage was often not what one would call flattering.

What I think is a significant criticism deals with the decades before, when he built this image of himself, with each news story serving as a brick in the artifice, as a self-made business tycoon. He definitely had successes, but he was reliant on his father in ways the public didn’t see and, thanks in part to the Times reporting on his tax returns <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/MBEYdngJ5HSDjNAfO-LT9g~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRlHUNRP0TfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUvMjAyMC8wOS8yNy91cy9kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtdGF4ZXMuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjIxMDAzJmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTczNTgzJm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9MTcwODgyNzIzJnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTA4ODA3JnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1lMzI3MjBjMjAxOGZmNjU5NjFjODQwM2ZkZjgyMTI0Y1cDbnl0QgpjM1G-OmNZRjvdUhBtMjUwMDcyQHVzbmEuZWR1WAQAAAAA> , learned about years later. That’s something the industry needs to reckon with.

Now, he’s a former president with a huge following, as he undermines faith in elections and embraces conspiracy theories. I’m not sure there’s a good argument for ignoring him, because he still gets heard through other means. There is a good argument for contextualizing him.

David: What happens next? Does he want to be president again or just get revenge on Biden? And what do you think motivates him?

Maggie: I think Trump misses the pomp and legal protections that the presidency afforded him. I also think he wants revenge on Biden, and on the media, and on a whole range of people. And he wants to be able to continue to raise money and get attention, both of which disappear if he doesn’t run. What I’m not clear on is that he really wants to wage another campaign, in part because he’s that much older and in part because he seems less engaged generally. But that will reveal itself in the coming weeks or months.

‘Not working right now’

A rising generation of Republican politicians is more skeptical of the free market and more comfortable using government power to regulate the economy than the party has traditionally been. Consider:

*	Senator J.D. Vance, the Ohio Republican, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts progressive, have collaborated on a bill to claw back executive pay at failed banks. The two worked through the details <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/gu_E1nnx4pQMQEMv4iDG5A~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmdASeP0TyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG9saXRpY28uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNi8wMS93YXJyZW4tdmFuY2UtZmFpbGVkLWJhbmtpbmctY3JhY2tkb3duLWJpbGwtMDAwOTk1Nzk_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIzMDYyMCZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD05NTU0NyZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTE3MDg4MjcyMyZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzNjE1MyZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9ZTMyNzIwYzIwMThmZjY1OTYxYzg0MDNmZGY4MjEyNGNXA255dEIKZHief5Fk5cKqhVIQbTI1MDA3MkB1c25hLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~>  through in-person conversations, weekend phone calls and late-night texts.
*	Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has signed a public letter calling for the reinvigoration of collective bargaining and praising the German approach, in which labor unions play a larger role in the economy. Rubio this month published a book, “Decades of Decadence,” that criticizes the past 30 years of globalization.
*	Senator Todd Young of Indiana has helped write a bipartisan bill to restrict noncompete agreements, which companies use to prevent their employees from leaving for jobs at a competitor.
*	Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas was among a bipartisan group of lawmakers who began pushing a few years ago for federal subsidies to expand domestic semiconductor manufacturing. President Biden signed a version of the policy last year.

Tomorrow afternoon, these four Republican senators — Cotton, Rubio, Vance and Young — will speak at an event on Capitol Hill that’s meant to highlight the emergence of a populist conservative movement in economics. The event is organized around a policy manifesto <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/5mxHp882uFpwShcbWQK74g~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmdASeP0TRaHR0cHM6Ly9hbWVyaWNhbmNvbXBhc3Mub3JnL3JlYnVpbGRpbmctYW1lcmljYW4tY2FwaXRhbGlzbS8_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIzMDYyMCZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD05NTU0NyZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTE3MDg4MjcyMyZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzNjE1MyZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9ZTMyNzIwYzIwMThmZjY1OTYxYzg0MDNmZGY4MjEyNGNXA255dEIKZHief5Fk5cKqhVIQbTI1MDA3MkB1c25hLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~> , called “Rebuilding American Capitalism: A Handbook for Conservative Policymakers.”

“We really like capitalism, but we recognize it’s not working right now,” said Oren Cass, a former aide to Mitt Romney and the executive director of American Compass, a think tank that published the manifesto.

Cass is right about that: Income growth for most families has been sluggish for decades <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/t0OdhSmtJvhGLsW8-_hj6g~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmdASeP0TtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUvMjAxNy8wOC8wNy9vcGluaW9uL2xlb25oYXJkdC1pbmNvbWUtaW5lcXVhbGl0eS5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA2MjAmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTU1NDcmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD0xNzA4ODI3MjMmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzYxNTMmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWUzMjcyMGMyMDE4ZmY2NTk2MWM4NDAzZmRmODIxMjRjVwNueXRCCmR4nn-RZOXCqoVSEG0yNTAwNzJAdXNuYS5lZHVYBAAAAAA~> , trailing well behind economic growth. Life expectancy stagnated <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/yLQZVsCmlJbhisNH5N-2ZA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmdASeP0TqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUvMjAyMC8wMy8wNi9vcGluaW9uL3dvcmtpbmctY2xhc3MtZGVhdGgtcmF0ZS5odG1sP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTkmZW1jPWVkaXRfbm5fMjAyMzA2MjAmaW5zdGFuY2VfaWQ9OTU1NDcmbmw9dGhlLW1vcm5pbmcmcmVnaV9pZD0xNzA4ODI3MjMmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0xMzYxNTMmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPWUzMjcyMGMyMDE4ZmY2NTk2MWM4NDAzZmRmODIxMjRjVwNueXRCCmR4nn-RZOXCqoVSEG0yNTAwNzJAdXNuYS5lZHVYBAAAAAA~>  even before Covid. And polls show that Americans of all ideological stripes are frustrated with the country’s direction.

“Capitalism is a complex system dependent on rules and institutions,” Cass told me. “And conservatism calls for building and maintaining institutions that work well.”


A new capitalism

I recognize that many liberals will be skeptical of the new breed of Republicans. For one thing, they really are conservative; they’re not disaffected right-wingers who have become moderates without admitting it. They support abortion restrictions and oppose gun laws. They make excuses for Donald Trump’s anti-democratic behavior or even spread his falsehoods.

But the preference for a different kind of economic policy than one Republicans have long supported is nonetheless significant. It is a sign that the consensus in Washington is moving away <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/Ldaj9YSa6NN-uwtOpu8A7Q~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmdASeP0TaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xMy9vcGluaW9uL2JpZGVuLXRydW1wLXBvcHVsaXNtLmh0bWw_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIzMDYyMCZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD05NTU0NyZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTE3MDg4MjcyMyZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTEzNjE1MyZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9ZTMyNzIwYzIwMThmZjY1OTYxYzg0MDNmZGY4MjEyNGNXA255dEIKZHief5Fk5cKqhVIQbTI1MDA3MkB1c25hLmVkdVgEAAAAAA~~>  from the neoliberal, laissez-faire approach that has dominated since the 1980s. These new conservatives are trying to separate themselves from anti-government Republicans like Paul Ryan — and, although they won’t say so, Ronald Reagan.

One major reason is the class inversion of American politics <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/AkgS3Bcc18w5SnRi9e5x9w~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmdASeP0TfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8xMy9icmllZmluZy9kZW1vY3JhdHMtZWxlY3Rpb25zLXBvbGwuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNjIwJmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTk1NTQ3Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9MTcwODgyNzIzJnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTM2MTUzJnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1lMzI3MjBjMjAxOGZmNjU5NjFjODQwM2ZkZjgyMTI0Y1cDbnl0QgpkeJ5_kWTlwqqFUhBtMjUwMDcyQHVzbmEuZWR1WAQAAAAA> . Most professionals now vote for Democrats, which is a stark change from past decades. Most working-class voters vote Republican, partly because they see Democrats as an elite party dominated by socially liberal and secular college graduates.

Yet the Republican Party still has a major vulnerability with working-class voters. The party has long pushed the laissez-faire agenda that has hurt those voters, and polls show the country to be left of center on economic policy. Most Americans favor a higher minimum wage, higher taxes on the rich, expanded government health insurance and subsidies for well-paying jobs.

When Democrats can flip the script on elitism and paint a Republican candidate as an out-of-touch protector of the rich, the Democratic candidate can often draw enough blue-collar support to win. John Fetterman used this approach to beat Mehmet Oz last year in Pennsylvania, the only state where a Senate seat switched parties.

Politically, the new conservative populism is an effort to show that Republicans understand Americans’ struggles and want to help. Economically, the new approach offers a glimpse of a Republican Party that’s starting to grapple with the economy’s true challenges.

The manifesto rejects the idea that free trade is inherently good and argues for policies to ensure the U.S. has a thriving, well-paying manufacturing sector that makes strategically important goods like semiconductors. “The idea that trade would lead to liberalization and a happy world was wildly wrong,” Cass said.

The document also calls for:

*	a guaranteed right for workers to organize and industrywide bargaining, which could increase the number of union contracts — and raise wages.
*	a financial transaction tax, meant to reduce Wall Street trading that makes people rich without making the economy more productive.
*	a monthly child benefit of around $300, as well as changes to Medicare and Social Security to recognize the work done by stay-at-home parents.
*	an easing of government regulations <https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/8nMlyq8n_qMWEaoFN5h8Sw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRmdASeP0TraHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8xMi9icmllZmluZy9lbGVjdHJpY2FsLWdyaWQtYW1lcmljYS1jbGVhbi1lbmVyZ3kuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjMwNjIwJmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTk1NTQ3Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9MTcwODgyNzIzJnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9MTM2MTUzJnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD1lMzI3MjBjMjAxOGZmNjU5NjFjODQwM2ZkZjgyMTI0Y1cDbnl0QgpkeJ5_kWTlwqqFUhBtMjUwMDcyQHVzbmEuZWR1WAQAAAAA> , to encourage new construction.

Progressives will raise principled objections to some ideas — such as a ban on unions’ campaign donations. And that’s how a democracy should function. The country’s two political parties are not on the verge of agreeing about most economic issues.

But something is changing.

Good work posting the chits on your doors. Send me a photo over email or text (503)707-1193 of whatever you need fixed so I can write a good description for commandant facilities. Thanks!

I will be updating the google sheet with work order #s. Write down those numbers on your door chits next to the corresponding discrepancies.

Here's the sheet again:

		The alpha inspection is one week from today, Thursday, 24Feb! Before that happens, we're going to run through a room checklist to get any last-minute work orders in.
		_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
		Here is what I need from you, due Tuesday at 1200:

		1.	Print a Material Discrepancies Inspection Chit (1 per room)
		2.	Complete the chit by inspecting your room

			1.	Perform a thorough and in-depth inspection
			2.	The goal is to identify all discrepancies that exist - but don't make up problems that don't exist
			3.	Fill out everything besides the W/0# /SH Request column and the bottom signature box

		3.	Input all discrepancies found into the 15th Co 1st LT Discrepancy Tracker <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LpEbbGLMJ8WiPfCa8_R0qqdK1YfqScbAa9DzrAr2TBI/edit?usp=sharing> 
			
		4.	^^^ feel free to do this over the weekend so I can submit you work orders ASAP
		5.	Post the chit on the outside of your door with tape
			
		6.	Keep your chits on the door until I take them down

		I'll send out a reminder on Monday night

		______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
		

		For the Alpha:

		*	You will NOT be hit for an in-progress work order
		*	You WILL be hit if there is a room discrepancy and you have not submitted a work order to me
		*	Use midstore stripper and mop n glo
		*	Do NOT use industrial stripper, use commercial grade
		*	DO use some elbow grease and avoid using a stripping machine
		*	3 coats of mop n glo and you're good to go

Good evening, actors, entertainers, crafters, and (puppeteers????),

BLUF: Auditions and Tech Call for Argonautika, the Fall show, is THIS THURSDAY, 09Sep21 at 1530 in Mahan Theatre.

Are you a midshipman? Particularly one who is interested in performing drama, literature, poetry, and the like? Well boy, oh boy, do I have a proposition for you. This Fall, the Masqueraders will be putting on Argonautika, the tale of Jason and the Argonauts. You could say it will be quite "epic." (Nice pun, loser). 

Anyway, we are looking for 15-20 bright-eyed, bushy-tailed actors and an enthusiastic, dedicated team of creative, innovative engineers (fun way of saying tech crew).

Also on the docket is, yes, puppeteers. I know what you're thinking. "Wow, I had always wanted to be a puppeteer when I grew up, and now I finally have my shot to show off my master puppeteering/ventriloquist license." As a side note, I'm definitely not projecting.

If any of these positions make you warm and bubbly inside, I'll catch you in Mahan Theatre this Thursday, 09Sep21, at 1530. 

Stay based, Brigade.

Very respectfully,
H. C. Norman
MIDN     USN

Bring your swim rolls and a big smile for tomorrow, it should be a fun one.
Muster 0530, we will be stepping off immediately at 0530 to ensure we can claim our pool space. 

In order to reduce the need to explain the workout tomorrow morning, this is our current plan:

minute 0-10: instructional period. We will each be running a “station” and you all can choose whatever you'd like extra work on. Stations will be freestyle, CSS, treading, 2’s/underwater. 

minute 10-20: Swim workout. 1 lap every minute for 10 minutes. To allow confident swimmers to scale this up, it will be optional to make the first length an underwater, and optional to scale up the distance.

minute 20-30: Tread workout. 1 min easy tread, 1 minute hard tread for 10 minutes. You get to choose what the “easy” is for you and what the “hard” is for you, since we are at different levels. For example, this could be alternating between hands out of the water and elbows out of the water if you are a confident treader.

Very Respectfully,
R.G. Hoffman
MIDN     USN

Good morning 29!

Are you cool? Are you a tough guy? If so, please respond to this email so that I can track the only real screener that the Naval Academy has to offer.

If you have 1) never worn your IKE (except the days when required for formation) and 2) have never worn your NWU fleece, please respond. Your picture will be eternally honored on my plebe board for everyone to see until you stop being a tough guy.

25.   Beijing Is On A Wartime Footing
Biden needs to rebuild America’s ‘arsenal of democracy’ or risk being unprepared.
(WALL STREET JOURNAL 02 JAN 24) ... Seth G. Jones
The good news about U.S.-China relations is that last month the two countries restored military-to-military dialogue after a 16-month rupture. The bad news is that it hasn’t slowed the military buildup in Beijing, which increasingly appears to be on a wartime footing. The U.S. needs to do likewise and reassemble what President Franklin D. Roosevelt referred to as the nation’s “arsenal of democracy.”

26.   Xi Jinping Says Happy New Year

27.   Russia’s Deadly New Salvos Challenge Congress To Respond
(WASHINGTON POST 02 JAN 24) ... Editorial Board
The Soviet Union designed the S-300, a mobile, surface-to-air defense weapons system, during the Cold War to hit incoming U.S. bombers or ballistic missiles. An S-300 can fire a projectile with a 293-pound high-explosive warhead, capable of stopping targets moving at more than 2,600 miles per hour. On Friday, Russia unleashed 14 of these deadly devices, not defensively against airplanes or missiles, but offensively at cities in Ukraine. They were part of a wave of missiles and drones that marked the largest one-day aerial attack on Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion 22 months ago.

28.   The Military’s Phantom ‘Extremists
An independent study puts to rest another false media narrative.
(WALL STREET JOURNAL 02 JAN 24) ... Editorial Board
Good news: The U.S. military isn’t packed with violent extremists. That’s the gist of a new report commissioned by the Pentagon in 2021 and released quietly with little notice in December. The result won’t surprise Americans who have spent time in uniform, but it should calm the media frenzy about right-wing radicals in the armed forces.
